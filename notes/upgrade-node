Use n module from npm in order to upgrade node

sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable

To upgrade to latest version (and not current stable) version, you can use

sudo n latest

    Fix PATH:

      sudo apt-get install --reinstall nodejs-legacy     # fix /usr/bin/node

    To undo:

      sudo n rm 6.0.0     # replace number with version of Node that was installed
      sudo npm uninstall -g n

You may need to restart your terminal to see the updated node version.
